# Color Palettes

Welcome to the practical test exercice of Color Palettes, in this exercice you are asked to download this repository and start with it. You will have to add the missing Javascript (and css code if needed) to make it work.
Your tasks will be to: 
    
    - Assign a random color for each card on page load.
    - Each time you change the color of the card, the badge at the end of it must be updated accordingly.
    - Add a reset button at the top right corner of the page that will reset the colors.
    
A video is attached with the expected result.
